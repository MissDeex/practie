    <title> Learning how to code </title>
    </head>
  title goes in the head 
    ---> before adding context etc i need to close the head because this is for seo/ metadata/ keywords etc for search engines
  Body is after head closed this is so we can start on sub headings and paragraphs etc
<body> 
  <h1> Practising how to code step by step </h1>
<p> I'm currently working on learning how to code from scratch line by line </p>
<p> <strong> this is for bold </strong></p>
<p> <elm> this is an element? i think not sure exactly what it does </elm></p>
  <p> <em> this is for italics </em></p>
<p> <image> this one helps me add an image howvere i need to add more to it like src="dog.jpg" for example however id need to upload the image of the dog and put it in a seperate file and name it that so i dont know what it will do without the image lets see</image> </p>
<p> <br> this one helps give me a break between the sentences </br> </p>
  <ul>
<h2>now moving on to lists</h2>
<li> sad llama </li>
    <li>happy llama</li>
    <li> mentally disturbed llama </li>
</ul>
<br></br>
  <script> this is ment to embed something i dunno what lol </script>
  <h3> now this bit is for ordered lists </h3>
  <ol>
    <li> this is an ordered list compated to ul which is an unordered list </li>
    <li> sad llamaaa </li>
    <li> happy llamaa </li>
    <li> mentally disturbed llaaamaa </li>
    </ol> 

  <h3> Ok now we are looking at making lists in list "nesting" which works like subheading so extra info i guess? </h3> 
  <p> so i guess for this one we start with ol and then add ul when we want to add extra info then close them all in order at the bottom lets test it out</p>
  <ol> 
  <li> sad llama </li>
    <ul> 
      <li> this particular llama is super sad </li>  
    </ul>
  </ol>

  <ol> 
  <li> happy llama </li>
    <ul> 
      <li> this particular llama is very happy </li>  
    </ul>
  </ol>

  <ol> 
  <li> mentally disturbed llama </li>
    <ul> 
      <li> this particular llama is very disturbed </li>  
    </ul>
  </ol>

<h4>ok onto styling a little so if i want to add bold and italics its important 
to add them in with the paragraph one before adding in the italics which is em for emphasis or the strong for bold </h4>

  <br> </br>

  <p> so <em> this </em> is <strong> how </strong>how we do this </p>
